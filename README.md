# Time Series Forecasting with Simple RNN

This project demonstrates how to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for time series forecasting. The implementation is provided in the Jupyter Notebook [`ts-rnn-forecast.ipynb`](ts-rnn-forecast.ipynb).

## Features

- Preprocessing of time series data
- Building and training a simple RNN model
- Visualizing predictions against actual data

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
